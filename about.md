## Academic qualifications : 
- I am a Master's and Honours graduate in Computer Science at the University of Cape Town where I engaged with research participants to set up, implement, monitor, and manage users’ Web QoE and network QoS data pipelines through Internet Measurement. Courses included Big Data, High-Performance Computing, AI, HCI, Functional programming, Compilers I & II, and Research Methods
- Prior to that, In 2017 I completed my undergraduate in Computer Science from Uganda Christian Univerity 

## Past Experiences
- Previously worked at WWW Foundation’s A4AI as a consultant Data Analyst to elaborate on the importance of Meaningful Connectivity for all by collecting and analyzing relevant data around the world.

- In both 2020 and 2021 I contributed to industry-lead projects as a Junior Research Engineer at AFRINIC & Internet Society. I set-up and maintained the project’s data pipeline and ingested data to GCP data warehouse. Other tasks involved data analysis/viz with Bigquery & Data Studio. In the process, I wrote scripts in standard SQL to access the 2M+ rows of data located in multiple cloud providers using BigQuery and constructed & presented interactive dashboards of the data to various stakeholders.

I leveraged RESTFUL APIs to monitor 15 RPIs hosted in 12 different African countries in an automated fashion through a Telegram Bot I developed. This was a plus for reporting to the stakeholders.

- In my earlier undergraduate days I developed Software tools in Java, following AGILe and User-Centered methodologies and MongoDB No-SQL database.

My current efforts are towards mastering Network Automation through API development, Data Engineering, and DevOps.
