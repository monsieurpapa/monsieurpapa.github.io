I’m Software & Data Engineer currently helping to build SDN/SDWAN systems that automate telecommunication companies’ business processes. 

## Current Stack : 
- Server:  Python Django, Flask, Haproxy, Nginx, RESTFul & GraphQL APIs.
- Client: Bootstrap, Jquery, Ajax, React
- Databases: PostgreSQL, InfluxDb, Redis, MySQL
- DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, Vagrant
- Cloud: AWS, GCP
- Other Tech tools : Celery Beat, Kafka, Telegraf, ContainerLab, Netbox

## Academic qualifications : 
I am a Master's and Honours graduate in Computer Science at the University of Cape Town where I engaged with research participants to setup, implement, monitor, and manage users’ Web QoE and network QoS data pipelines through Internet Measurement.

## Past Experiences
- Previously worked at WWW Foundation’s A4AI as a consultant Data Analyst to elaborate on the importance of Meaningful Connectivity for all by collecting and analyzing relevant data around the world.

- In both 2020 and 2021 I contributed to industry-lead projects as a Junior Research Engineer at AFRINIC & Internet Society. I set-up and maintained the project’s data pipeline and ingested data to GCP data warehouse. Other tasks involved data analysis/viz with Bigquery & Data Studio. In the process, I wrote scripts in standard SQL to access the 2M+ rows of data located in multiple cloud providers using BigQuery and constructed & presented interactive dashboards of the data to various stakeholders.

I leveraged RESTFUL APIs to monitor 15 RPIs hosted in 12 different African countries in an automated fashion through a Telegram Bot I developed. This was a plus for reporting to the stakeholders.

- In my earlier undergraduate days I developed Software tools in Java , following AGILe and User-Centered methodologies and MongoDB No-SQL database.

My current efforts are towards mastering Network Automation through API development, Data Engineering, and DevOps.
