I’m a final year Masters Student and Honours graduate in Computer Science at the University of Cape Town. My topic is on Internet Measurements. 

 In both 2020 and 2021 I contributed to industry-lead projects as a Junior Research Engineer at AFRINIC & Internet Society. Whereby I used Python and Google’s Bigquery Server-less data warehouse to setup and manage the ETL process of the data, and analyse huge Internet Performance datasets located on both GCS and Amazon EC2 in the aim of understanding the resilience of the Internet in Africa. I leveraged RESTFUL APIs to monitor 15 RPIs hosted in 12  different African countries in an automated fashion through a Telegram Bot I developed . This was a plus for reporting to the stakeholders.

I’ve written scripts in standard SQL to access the 2M+ rows in BigQuery and made interactive dashboards of the data for various stakeholders.
I’ve developed Software tools in Java , following AGILe and User-Centered methodologies. These databases used were MongoDB No-SQL db and MySQL respectively.

In addition to that I implemented Zimmerman’s Pretty Good Privacy encryption algorithm to secure the communication channel of a system I developed whereas The complexity of the system was simplified by leveraging object-oriented practices of Java programming.

My current efforts are towards mastering Data Engineering on one side, and API development on the other using a combination of Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, Bigquery/SQLite, and more.

Technologies : Docker, Git, GCP, Bigquery, PowerBI, Data Studio, Balena Fleet management for IoT

Tools:IntelliJ, Android Studio, VSCode, Postman, Jupyter Notebook & Jupiter Lab, Gephi . 

Languages: Python, Java (Proficient), Go (Beginner-level)
