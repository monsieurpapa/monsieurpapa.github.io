I’m a final year Masters Student and Honours graduate in Computer Science at the University of Cape Town. I involve end-users into Internet Measurement experiments to assess their QoE & QoS of networks.

I got Involved with WWW Foundation’s A4AI as consultant Data Analyst as a contribution to the fight for a Meaningful Connectivity for everyone by collecting and analysing relevant data around the world.

 In both 2020 and 2021 I contributed to industry-lead projects as a Junior Research Engineer at AFRINIC & Internet Society. I did set-up and maintained the project’s data pipeline and ingested to a GCP data warehouse. Other tasks involved data analysis/viz with Bigquery & Data Studio. In the process, I wrote scripts in standard SQL to access the 2M+ rows from multiple cloud providers using BigQuery and constructed & presented interactive dashboards of the data for various stakeholders.

I leveraged RESTFUL APIs to monitor 15 RPIs hosted in 12  different African countries in an automated fashion through a Telegram Bot I developed . This was a plus for reporting to the stakeholders.

In earlier days I developed Software tools in Java , following AGILe and User-Centered methodologies. These databases used were MongoDB No-SQL db and MySQL respectively.

In the process,I  implemented Zimmerman’s Pretty Good Privacy encryption algorithm to secure the communication channel of a system I developed whereas The complexity of the system was simplified by leveraging object-oriented practices of Java programming.

My current efforts are towards mastering Data Engineering : currently playing with New York Taxi datasets by ingesting it to GCP with a combination of Docker, Terraform, Postgres, Bigquery, Airflow, Python and more CLI tools 

Technologies to date : Docker, Terraform ,Airflow, Git, GCP, Balena Fleet management for IoT

Tools:VSCode, Data Studio, Postman, Jupyter Notebook & Jupiter Lab, Gephi . 

Languages: Python(Proficient), Java (Proficient), Go (Beginner-level)
