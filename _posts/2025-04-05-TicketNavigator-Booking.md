Lake Kivu is a vital transport artery, yet booking a seat on a boat has traditionally been a manual, time-consuming process. TicketNavigator digitalizes this experience with a modern web and mobile platform.

### ⛴️ Seamless Booking Experience

TicketNavigator provides a unified interface for:
- **Passenger Bookings:** Search routes, select ships, and choose ticket classes (Standard, VIP).
- **Digital Tickets:** QR-code based ticketing for fast boarding verification.
- **Payment Integration:** Secure transaction handling for multi-company boat operators.

### ⚙️ Under the Hood

- **Backend:** Node.js & Express powering a robust API.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for handling high-concurrency booking requests.
- **Admin Panel:** Specialized dashboards for boat companies to manage schedules, passenger manifests, and revenue.
- **PWA Ready:** Designed to work as a mobile app for travelers on the go.

This project significantly reduces queues at ports and provides boat operators with real-time data on their operations.
