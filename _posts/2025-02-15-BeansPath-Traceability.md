BeansPath is a production-ready platform built to bring transparency to the coffee and cocoa supply chains. It ensures that every batch of beans can be traced back to its origin, providing value to both farmers and high-end buyers.

### 🌟 Project Highlights

- **Full Traceability:** Tracks harvest batches from the farm plot through processing, export, and final delivery.
- **AI Insights:** Uses **Google Gemini AI** to provide farmers with personalized recommendations based on harvest data and soil conditions.
- **Geospatial Visualization:** Integrated Leaflet maps for visualizing farm plots and tracking logistics in real-time.
- **Enterprise-Grade Security:** Google OAuth 2.0, RBAC (Role-Based Access Control), and hardened Docker infrastructure.

### 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Frontend:** React 18 + TypeScript + Vite.
- **Infrastructure:** Nginx reverse proxy, Docker Compose orchestration.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with PostGIS for spatial tracking of farm boundaries.
- **Localization:** Full i18next support for English, French, and Spanish.

BeansPath isn't just a database; it's an ecosystem that empowers smallholder farmers by giving them a digital identity and proof of origin for their high-quality crops.
